                <h1>Are you ready, cadet?</h1>
                <p>
                    NOW is your time to shine, cadet! Have you dreamt of space
                    ever since you could dream? It's time to embark on the most
                    significant adventure of your life and join the Galactic
                    Expedition today!
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a cadet, you will get to live and train with your fellow
                    cadets on Moon Station 4XT, our most prestigious and
                    high-tech facility. Spock himself trained on Moon station
                    4XT! <br />
                    Here you will experience the essence of space and space
                    travel, and eventually become a space officer! Space
                    officers will travel on the Exploration Vessel XT3297 to
                    distant galaxies, alternate universes and alien timelines.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We work in close co-operation with the Nanoborgs and
                    Glitchtrons to build, sustain, and develop our technologies.
                    Nanoborgs are responsible for tech innovation and keeping
                    our systems running, as well as medical assistance. <br />
                    Glitchtrons are in charge of training our cadets to become
                    the best pilots, fighters, medics, scientists, mechanics,
                    programmers, and explorers they can be.
                </p>

                </span>

                <p>
                    Cadet training will start with a week of intensive aptitude
                    testing and orientation with fellow cadets. Basic training
                    will continue for another 6 moons, honing skills necessary
                    for space exploration and safety proceedures. <br />
                    After basic training, cadets will be interviewed by our
                    station co-ordinator and assigned a specialty, which
                    include; pilot, commander, medic, mechanic, programmer,
                    scientist, explorer or fighter. Other hybrid specializations
                    are available further along in your career. <br />
                    <br />
                    Each cadet will learn the basics of their specialization for
                    another 6 moons, and then be transfered accordingly to our
                    stations on Neptune, Pluto, Saturn and Mars.

                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p>
                    The Space Expedition's ultimate goal is to map the universe
                    and all alternate realities, and create a coalition of
                    humanoids and aliens alike. Exploration is essential for
                    survival, innovation and material acquision. <br />
                    <br />
                    Intergalactic travel cannot be mentioned without word of our
                    arch-enemies, the Daleks! We must defeat them at all costs,
                    for they threaten our very existence. <br />
                    Their planet Skaro houses the most valuable material in all
                    universes, Quantum Bandwidth, which is necessary for all our
                    operations, particularly intergalactic communications.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The Space Expedition actively works on scientific solutions
                    to acquire Quantum Bandwidth from the sectors of the
                    universe we control. All discovery leaders are handsomely
                    rewarded.
