                <h4>Creative Process</h4>
                <p>
                    Starting out, I didn't plan anything specific, but instead
                    thought of going for a simple design for the front page,
                    that would fill assignment requirements, and started playing
                    with how that would look. I added some styles that I found
                    appealing, and once I was happy with the general look, I
                    started thinking about content. <br />
                    <br />
                    At first, I thought I would make a CV, and then a blog, but
                    eventually, I came up with the idea to create space-themed
                    content, as my styles already had some dark colors and stars
                    in them, and I was able to tie in the game concept and form
                    nicely into the fantasy space cadet recruitment idea. I also
                    added more styles that synergized with my website concept.
                    <br />
                    I chose this over the other options because it gave me a
                    good excuse and freedom to experiment with javascript and
                    different implementations.

                <h4>File Structure and Testing</h4>
                <p>
                    Validation: CSS is valid, and all HTML is valid aside from
                    the trailing slash infos.
                    <br />
                    Tested on: Firefox 131.0.3, Chrome 130.0.6723.70, and
                    Microsoft Edge 130.0.2849.56. Works as intended.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Tested on all devices in responsive dev-tools for basic
                    layout and functionality. Responsivity works well above
                    400px but will not break between 300-400px either. Under
                    300px is not supported at this time.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Below is my file structure, some of the file names are
                    slightly different than the final page titles, but still
                    clear enough. 5 HTMLs for 5 pages, one CSS file for all
                    stylings, one JS file for the game code. The fonts include
                    the one font used on all themed pages aside from this one,
                    and pictures are all visible across the website.
                    <br />
                    I elected not to use a framework in my project.

                <p>
                    The HTML for each of my pages is rather simple, with the
                    exception of the game and the form, the rest is stuff we
                    learnt in class. <br />
                    <br />
                    I made the structure of the form page using the guides on
                    W3schools, and in Tiko-support Topi and I tested and
                    troubleshooted the form submission functionality with
                    different solutions from stackoverflow and mdn. I added
                    javascript directly into the html this time, instead of
                    making a separate file.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                </p>
                <h4>Challenges & Troubleshooting</h4>
                <p>
                    Overall, there were no impossible problems, but some areas
                    took a good while to figure out. The hardest relevant
                    problems were to do with the CSS and mediaqueries.
                    Eventually as the page got long enough, it became more
                    challenging to keep track of what was affecting what, and
                    there may still be some repetition or overlapping elements
                    that I missed.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Issues with positioning were the most challenging by far.
                    Particularly with finding a navigation style that looked
                    decent on smaller screens. Using resources such as w3, mdn,
                    stackoverflow and ChatGPT helped a lot to solve many of the
                    issues, and TIKO support was the most invaluable resource.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The game and the form were very challenging for sure, but I
                    learnt a lot and had fun. I wanted to add more effects found
                    on codepen, for example, but they were too complex for me to
                    understand and implement correctly at this point.

                <h4>Game Documentation</h4>
                <p>
                    The original code for the numbers game is made by me as an
                    assignment for our programming class.
                    <br />
                    Since we haven't exactly learned how to implement Javascript
                    into websites (and I made the game near the beginning of the
                    project, before learning functions in programming), I
                    elected to ask ChatGPT to transform my code into website
                    compatible code. This wasn't part of the assignment criteria
                    so I felt I could liberally use ChatGPT for the code and
                    functional structure of the game. <br />
                    <br />
                    There were inevitably quite a few tweaks needed for the game
                    to function properly and as I intended. I fixed several
                    issues, particularly with faulty inputs, in TIKO-support
                    with the help of Topi. <br />
                    <br />
                    I now understand the new Javascript code of the game, and I
                    can see that there's a function that does the same things my
                    original code did, with if statements checking for errors
                    and invalid inputs. Here is my original code:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <span class="screenshotofcodepic">
                        <img
                            id="screenshotofcode"
                            src="./pics/screenshotofcode.png"
                            alt="picofcode"
                        />
                    </span>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="docbox">
                <h4>CSS Style Documentation</h4>
                <p>
                    There's a lot going on in my CSS file, and I tried to
                    organize it well. The file is divided into sections that
                    include the styling for each individual HTML page for
                    clarity. I also added notes in relevant locations to clarify
                    what element something affects, and generally in what ways.
                    <br />
                    I decided on the current structure to improve readability,
                    with all the specific stylings for each page separated.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    General styles determines how the main index.html looks, as
                    well as other styles throughout the webpage that don't need
                    specific targetting: overall styling for the body, content
                    containers, navigation, and footer, which generally remains
                    the same throughout the separate pages. The @keyframes
                    animation is generated by ChatGPT.<br />
                    Also contained are the flipcard styles for the front page,
                    and specific details such as how the images behave within
                    the paragraph element. <br />
                    <br />
                    Next up are the styles required for the game to function and
                    look the way I want it to. The stylings for the game are
                    made by me, which include positioning, colors, borders,
                    fonts, button styles, etc.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Gallery styles just has the flipcards slightly modified in
                    sizing and location in order to fit into the container.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Documentation styles includes an additional content
                    container, and a modified structure for the main content
                    area, I utilized grid here with stretch to organize the
                    boxes. The rest of the pages use flex. <br />
                    This was challenging and it took a long time to find the
                    correct solution for the boxes within the content container
                    to line up as they do.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Form styles mostly includes font colors for each element in
                    the form, as well as styling for the submission button, and
                    some positioning.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Lastly are the mediaqueries for several different widths. I
                    chose custom viewport widths which aligned with the
                    fucntionality and breakpoints of my website. There are many
                    more than required, but this ensures that the website worked
                    and looked decent on all devices.

                    Through this project, I feel like I internalized everything
                    we learnt in class and put most of it into practice, and
                    learned a whole lot more. Best of all, I had an absolute
                    blast completing this! <br />
                    Turning it in was the hardest part, I felt like I needed to

                    time on this than the proposed assignment hours.
